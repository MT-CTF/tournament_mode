# tournament_mode

Tournament mode for CTF, code taken from from CTF's [classes mode](https://github.com/MT-CTF/capturetheflag/tree/master/mods/ctf/ctf_modes/ctf_mode_classes) and modified by LoneWolfHT

This mod should only be used on server dedicated to running tournament matches. It's possible for players to end up without interact privs if you disable the mod.
