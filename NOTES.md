This is a 3v3 double elimination tournament. Challonge shows 1v1 because only team leaders register.
Two teams of 3 face off against each other, the team that captures the other's flag wins. The winner moves on to play against other winners, and the loser moves into the lower bracket, where they will fight other teams that lost.
If you lose twice you're out of the tournament. At the end of the tournament you'll have the winners bracket team (the only one that hasn't lost) vs the surviving lower bracket team, and if the lower bracket team can defeat the winner's bracket one twice they win the tournament.

- To keep things on a relatively even playing field the minimum Minetest version is 5.7
- Only the team leader signs up on Challonge
- Team leaders should join each of the tournament servers and set their team names with `/teamname` as they register on Challonge. Otherwise they will have to use their ingame name for their Challonge team name
  - Throughout the tournament you will be joining different servers depending on which ones are available, they don't sync data so you currently have to register your team in each one
  - This can be done as you're prepping for a match, but you will have to rejoin after setting your team name, and waiting that long isn't recommended
- Team leaders are responsible for managing their team members.
  - This includes making sure they know how the tournament works and what to do. If the team leader doesn't know they can ask a tournament manager and relay the info.
  - If they don't show up on time with enough players they will have to `/surrender` or run `/report_dq` for each missing player if they still want to try playing
- There will be *__0 tolerance__* for accidental or intentional messing around/interference with the tournament.
  - Don't join tournament servers unless you have a match there. The only specators allowed are officially appointed ones.
  - Don't run commands unless you're supposed to, e.g don't run `/report_dq` just to see what it does
  - Don't impersonate players or teams
  - No cheating
  - Use common sense, and ask your team leader/a tournament manager where unsure
- CTF is not balanced for tournaments at all, the first few tournaments may be extremely unfair, and things will probably be run really badly. Bear with it, and try to have fun anyway.
