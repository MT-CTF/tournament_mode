This is a 3v3 double elimination tournament. Challonge shows 1v1 because only team leaders register.
Two teams of 3 face off against each other in a classes match, the team that captures the other's flag wins. The winner moves on to play against other winners, and the loser moves into the lower bracket, where they will fight other teams that lost.
If you lose twice you're out of the tournament. At the end of the tournament you'll have the winners bracket team (the only one that hasn't lost) vs the surviving lower bracket team, and if the lower bracket team can defeat the winner's bracket one twice they win the tournament.

15 minutes before the tournament starts team leaders will get a checkin email and notification on challonge, if you don't check in your team will be auto-DQed with no penalty.
After the start date we'll play for 2 hours, then stop and pick things up again the next day.

When a match starts an email and notification will be sent to the participating team leaders letting them know and giving them the address of the server to play on.

- To keep things on a relatively even playing field the minimum Minetest version is 5.7
- Only the team leader needs to sign up on Challonge. But if their team members have accounts they can add them to the team.
- Throughout the tournament you will be joining different servers depending on which ones are available, team leaders will need to make sure their team knows which to join
- Team leaders are responsible for managing their team members.
  - This includes making sure they know how the tournament works and what to do. If the team leader doesn't know they can ask a tournament manager and relay the info.
  - If they don't show up on time with enough players they will have to `/surrender` or, if they're missing an equal amount of players, run `/report_dq` for each missing player if they still want to try playing
  - Your team can have members that aren't in the CTF Discord, but you have to be able to reliably coordinate with them to get your team into matches
- After a round has gone on for 30 minutes flag attempts will instant-capture
- You can only claim tournament rewards for the username you play as (listed by your team leader), and only if it's your account on the main server
- There will be *__0 tolerance__* for accidental or intentional messing around/interference with the tournament.
  - Don't join tournament servers unless you have a match there. The only specators allowed are officially appointed ones.
  - Don't run commands unless you're supposed to, e.g *don't* run `/report_dq` just to see what it does
  - Don't impersonate players or teams
  - No cheating or usage of things like CSMs that give an unfair advantage.
    - It's ok to change Minetest settings or use glitches like third person clipping.
  - No swearing/being rude. Keep the chat sportsmanlike and PG
  - Use common sense, and ask your team leader/a tournament manager where unsure
- CTF is not balanced for tournaments at all, the first few tournaments may be extremely unfair, and things will probably be run really badly. Bear with it, and try to have fun anyway. Things will improve over time.
